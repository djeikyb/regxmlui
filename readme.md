# UL

I want to easily search the SMPTE Universal Label Registers and also learn AvaloniaUi.

## Project organization

Following the example of Wiesław Šoltés, we have:

### Ul

Business logic.

### Ul.Core

ViewModels

### Ul.Tui

~~Cursed~~ Terminal Ui

### Ul.Ui

Avalonia Views (should this be Ul.AvaUi?)

### Ul.Desktop

Avalonia Desktop Ui (should this be Ul.AvaDesktop?)

### Ul.AvaIos

Doesn't exist and prolly won't.
But it would depend on Ul.Ui.
